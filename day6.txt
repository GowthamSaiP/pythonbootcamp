What is PEP 8?
  PEP-8 or the Python Enhancement Proposal presents some of the key points that you can use to make your code more organized and readable.
Operators
  Arithmetic Operators = + is for addition
                          - is for substraction
                          * is for multiplication
                          / is for division and returns a float value
                          // is for floor division only return integer value
                          % is for division to return the remainder
  Comparison Operators = == is for equal to
  > is for greater than
  >= is for greater than or equal to
  < less than
  <= less than or equal to
  
  Walrus Operator : Walrus Operator allows you to assign a value to a variable within an expression. 
    for ex; print(a:=10)
  
  If statement is used to check a condition and perform an action based on that condition
  Syntax : if number==10:
            process
  Elif is used to check other condtion when if statements condition is not met
  syntax : elif number==20
            process
  else is used to perform an operation when befor if conditions are not met
  syntax: else
          process
  For loop : A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence. With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
  syntax : for i in range(len(nums)):
  here, i is refering to index value
          for i in range(0,1)
  here the range is exclusive  meaning it wont consider 1
