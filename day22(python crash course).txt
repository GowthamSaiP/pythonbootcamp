Python : Python is a high level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
Why learn python 
  Python is widely used in various fields such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
    
Brief history of python
    Python was created by Guido Van Rossum and first released in 1991.
    
First program in python
    print("hello world") - this prints input on screen. hello world is input here, we can use single quotes instead of double quotes as well.
    
    Python uses indentation to indicate block of code and is not dependent on braces like many other languages.
    
Variables and dat types
    Variables are containers for stroing data values.

    Numeric data types
      Integers, floats and complex numbers are examples of numeric data types.
    Strings
      Strings represents sequence of characters enclosed within single or double quotes.
    Booleans
      Booleans represents truth values : true or false.

Basic operators
    Arithmetic operators : +, - , *, /, //, %, **(exponentiation)
    Comparison operators : ==, !=, >, <, <=, >=
    Logical operators = and, or, not.

Control flow : Conditional statements
  - if,elif,else statements
    Conditional statements are used for decision making in python.

Control flow : loops
    for
    while
    Loop control statements : break, continue

Data structures
    Lists : lists are ordered collection of items, which can be of different types.
      Creating Lists : Lists can be created by enclosing comma-seperated items within square brackets [].
      Accessing and modifyting list elements : Elements of a list can be accessed using index notation.
      Lists are mutable meaning their elements can be changed.
      List methods : append(), pop(), remove(), extend(), insert() etc..,

    Tuples : Tuples are ordered collection of items, similar to lists, but they are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.
      Creating tuples : Tuples can be created by enclosing comma-seperated items within paranthesis ().
      Accessing tuple items : Elements of tuple can be accessed using index notation, similar to lists.

    Sets : Sets are unordered collection of unique items.
      Creating sets : Sets can be created by enclosing comma-seperated items within curly braces {}, or using set() function.
      Accessing and modifying set elements : Sets do not support indexing or slicing as they are unordered. However, elements can be added or removed using methods like add(), remove(), discard() etc..,

    Dictionaries : Dictionaries are ordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and associated with a value.
      Creating dictionaries : Dictionaries can be created by enclosing key-value pairs within curly braces{} or by using dict() function. 
      Accessing and modifying dictionary elements : Dictionaries values can be accessed using thier keys. They are mutable, so values associated with keys can be changed. 
      Dictionary methods : keys(), values(), items(), update(), pop() etc..,
