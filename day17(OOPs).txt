OOPs - Object Oriented Programming System
  
A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them.
  
First we create a blueprint like this, class is a blueprint
  class student:
    pass     (pass is a keyword we use if there is no code or data inside class)
  in this class we can create multiple objects like below
  
  Rama=student()
  Rama.name = "Rama"
  Rama.fathername = "Dasaradha"

  lakshamana=student()
  lakshamana.name = "Lakshamana"
  lakshamana.fathername = "Dasaradha"

  Here rama and lakshamana are objects.

  Constructor Method : Constructors in Python is a special class method for creating and initializing an object instance at that class. In Python the __init__() method is called the 
  constructor and is always called when an object is created.
  example
  
  class student:
    def __init__(self,name,fathername):    //Self is a reserved word in PEP8, we can use any other word but self is recomended.
      self.name=name                      //
      self.fathername=fathername
  
  Rama = student("Rama","Dasaradha")
  Lakshamana = student("Lakshamana","Dasaradha")
