syntax for while loop
  while condition
for example
  temp=0
  while temp!=10:
    print(temp)
    temp=temp+1
  printf("off stove"). This loop increases the temp until it reaches 10 and then turns it off.

To read input from user we use input method
  
  a=input("Enter any number")
  by default this takes input as string type
  if we want to consider the input in any other data type, we specify like below
  a=int(input("Enter any number"))

  To read multiple variables in a single line, we use the following
  a,b=map(int,input("Enter two numbers").split(" ")). Here split method helps to specifiy that elements entered after space are taken as other element. we can use comma as well.

  examples :

  empty=[]
  n=int(input("Enter how many elements"))
  for i in range(n):
    empty.append(input("Enter Number"))
  print(empty).
  The above program takes elements input in a list.

  To do the same above program in a single line we use
  empty=list(map(int,input("Enter Numbers").split(" ")))
