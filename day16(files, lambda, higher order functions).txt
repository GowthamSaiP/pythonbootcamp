Files and files handling in python

  Files = To integrate downloading feature is one of the use cases of files.
  file=open("new.txt", "w") here w means write that create a text file with the name new.
  file.write("hello world"). \n can be used to generate the text afterwars in a new line.
  file = open("new.txt","r").
  file.close() to close the file.
  file=open(new.txt) to open the file.
  file.read() to read the file. we can give no.of characters as an argument. like file.read(5) to print 5 characters.
  file.readline() to read the files as line, we can give the line number as an argument like file.readlines(2) to read the second line.
  file(w,r,a) w,r,a arguments are modes w meaning write, r meaning read , a meaning append.

Higher Order Functions

  A function is called Higher Order Function if it contains other functions as a parameter or returns a function as an output i.e, the functions that operate with another function are     
  known as Higher order Functions.
  eg: map, filter etc..,
Lambda Functions

  lambda functions also known as anonymous funtions because we donot declare variable type, return value etc., to these functions, this helps us create a function in a single line.
  eg : substraction = lamba a,b:a-b

eg:
List = [1,2,3,4]
List1 = list(map(lambda x:x*x,List))
now List1 will have [1,4,9,16] as its elements.

List1=list(filter(lambda x:x>2,List))
now List1 will have [3,4] as its elements
if we use map here instead of filter List1 will have [false,false,true,true] as its elements.

** To perform operations on every element we use map function.
To filter out elements based on conditions we use filter function.
