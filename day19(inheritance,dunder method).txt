Inheritance
  Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
  Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.
  Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

Dunder/Magic method
  Python Magic methods are the methods starting and ending with double underscores ‘__’. They are defined by built-in classes in Python and commonly used for operator overloading. 
  They are also called Dunder methods, Dunder here means “Double Under (Underscores)”.
  Example
    __str__(self): Defines behavior for when str() is called on an instance of your class.
