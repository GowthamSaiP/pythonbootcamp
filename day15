In built functions in python
  type conversion functions
  
    nums = int(num)
    nums = str(num)
    nums = float(num)
    abs() function to find modulus number i.e, positive number

functions related to lists
  
  nums = list()- to create list
  append() to add element at last
  insert(index,element) to add element by index
  sorted() to sort the data
  pop() to remove element at last or index as an argument
  remove() to remove element by element as an argument
  zip() to read all the values from 2 lists given as arguments
  enumerate() to access value and index for that in a list

count() to count repetitions of an element given as the argument
max() to find maximum value
min() to find minimum value
sum() to find sum

  upper() to convert all the characters to upper
  title() to convert all the characters into camelcase 
  split(" ") to convert strings into lists seperated by spaces( in this case). since strings are immutable we do this to perform desired operations.
  join(name) to convert list to strings

functions related to sets
  
  nums=set() - to create set
  add() to add element
  remove() to remove element

functions related to dictionaries
  
  nums=dict() to create dictionaries
  nums[1]=2 - 1 is key and 2 is value
  keys() to iterate keys
  values() to iterate values
  items() to iterate both keys and values
  update({key:value}) to add pairs to dictionary
  get(key) to get value related to key given in the argument
