Why does indexing starts at 0?
The reason is the first element of a list or array is exactly contained in the memory location that array or list refers. This is called a offset distance of 0 and first element is 0 elements away from the array or list.
Static allocation - When the allocation of memory performs at the compile time, then it is known as static memory allocation.
dyanimc allocation - When the memory allocation is done at the execution or run time, then it is known as dynamic memory allocation.
  In python the dynamic allocation occurs at the rate of no.of elements multipled by 2 i.e, twice of the no.of elements present.
    For example, if there are 2 elements in a list, python will allocate memory sufficient to accomodate 2*2=4 values in that list.
 When are lists used?
 You can use these when you need a collection of similar/non similar items. 
 Real life example : storing name of a person, id of a person, height of person in a list.
                     a refrigirator is used to store soft drinks, vegetables and fruits.
