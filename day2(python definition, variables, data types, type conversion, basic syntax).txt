Python - Python is a high level, interpreted and dynamically typed programming language.

High level programming language - Programming languages that can be easily understood by coders because of usage of language in building logics.

Interpreted - In interpreted programming languages, the code is translated into machine language and executed line by line at its runtime.

Dynamically typed programming language - In dynamically typed programming languages, we do not need to specify the data type beforehand, it assigns the data type based on the value at runtime.

Variable - A variable is a container for storing any type of data and we give a label to that variable to access the data by just calling that variable label.

Data types - Integers, strings, boolean, float etc..,

type conversion - using type conversion method we can convert on data type of one variable to another data type.

syntax learnt --
  to print == print()
  variable and value assignment == a=10
  type conversion == b=str(a)
  to print data type of variable == print(type(a))
